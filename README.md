# Mario-Pyramid
Mario Pyramid dev challenge. Went overboard edition.

Edit: The code isn't as straightforward in some cases because it had to be changed up so that it would be easier to test it.

Edit2: I'll be honest, I kind of forgot about the challenge for the past two weeks. So I made only the core tests. I was initially planning to test the entire application in the InputTests.cs style, but there is no more time. However written tests do cover pretty much all input and pyramid drawing logic.
